# Rename Fishermen

* Status: Proposed
* Deciders: Protocol Eng. Team
* Date: 2023-04-24

## Context and Problem Statement

Fishermen is a canonically used term in blockchain spaces. In POKT Network, Fishermen are actors responsible for monitoring & reporting the behavior of Service nodes. However, the term Fishermen is ambiguous, overloaded, and doesn't describe its responsibilities in the protocol without additional context. None of other POKT actor roles have a maritime or sea based theme, further adding to the confusion. Additionally, pluralization preferences and spelling of `fishermen` is an ongoing issue in the codebase. For example, there are TODO comments about renaming `fisherman` to `fishermen`.

## Decision Drivers

- Clarity in names is important
- Uniformity in pluralization and spelling
- Gender neutrality

## Considered Options

- Auditor
- Checker
- Verifier
- Sampler

## Decision Outcome

_Decision pending_.

### Positive Consequences 

- It is clearer what the actor is called who checks and samples relay data.
